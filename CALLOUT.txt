I'm a talented programmer looking for a level designer, game designer, and/or pixel artist with whom I'd like to develop and polish 2d indie games as a hobby (not for profit.)

I've been coding my whole life and have earned his living for the past decade writing web software. I've always been interested in making games, but not in the games industry. I love challenging, learnable games and dislike the hand-holding and lack of gameplay in many modern games. Some of my favourites include X-COM, Zelda LTTP, and Final Fantasy Tactics.

I've never felt comfortable looking for anyone else to work with before because I didn't have any kind of portfolio. Consider this partially-completed HTML5 remake of the NES game Zelda II: The Adventure of Link my portfolio:

I wrote this in my free time over the last couple months. It runs well on newer browsers and my Galaxy Nexus (with the help of a several-line Java app), but terribly on my iPhone 4, for which I'm considering looking into PhoneGap as a fix. The great thing about HTML5 games is that support for them is getting better and better every time new browser versions come out! I'm equally capable of working in Action Script 3, but thought I might as well leap early from the sinking ship that is Flash.

I'm not dead set on continuing development on this Zelda 2 project; if you have some ideas and are open to some back-and-forth, I would be interested in starting on a brand new 2d game with a different concept. Or, if you're interested, I am equally interested in making a Zelda 2 "Master Quest": where the gameplay is similar to the original game, but the world, levels, graphics, enemies, and/or mechanics are new.
