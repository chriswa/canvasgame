TODO
  - add locked doors
  - fix keys (tie them to dungeons with a uniqueId on the entrance area?)
    - exit objects on overworld should specify 'dungeon' since ultimately I'll need to know in order to play the dungeon theme song -- i can use the entrance area's id as the dungeon id
  ? downward and upward thrusts
  ? candle, hammer, gloves, raft, boots, flute, cross
  ? spells
  ? elevators
  - more enemies: boomeranger, spear-chucker (early forest encounter), orange knights, white desert worms

CONSIDER
  - get rid of all "super" methods in Sprite-derived classes?
    - or not! look at all the stuff that Sprite.init does!
  - audio on android?
  - make it work in ie?

EDITOR?
  - don't support mobile! (more surface area to play with)
  - use html elements for textfields etc
  - hardcoded tile set, tile palette is off to the side
  - create enemies from dropdown (R.spawnableSprites)
  - button to instantly playtest
  ? how will multiple maps and exits work?

ONGOING
  - add a couple more enemies (especially bigger enemies -- more satisfying to kill!)
