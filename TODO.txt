TODO
  - onInjuredPlayer instead of onPlayerCollision being called only when not invincible for dangerous entities
  - sfx
    - noise while sword strikes solid blocks (noise during, then when collision ends, stop it and start separate noise)
    - continuous elevator noise (maybe just start a short clip repeatedly on a timer?)
  - more enemies:
    - orange knight
    - ground-scurrying thing in first dark cave
    - spear-chucker (early forest encounter)?
    - white desert worms?
  - more levels
  ? downward and upward thrusts
  ? candle, hammer, gloves, raft, boots, flute, cross
  ? spells

CONSIDER
  - make it work in ie?
  - map-property-specified alternate tileset name for "dark" (no candle)



"Good enemy design forces the player to play differently than they normally would, so the entire game does not consist of a single type of interaction. The Boomer does this quite well."
