NEW
  - input state for a menu
    - after setting the state, calling code should register buttons for both rendering and hittesting (position, size, text, colour, etc).
      - don't bother with keyboard support.
  - maybe App should own canvas and gfx instead of having globals?
  - App's graphics methods should exist in another object, or a sub-object. Maybe App.gfx?
  - Enemy should publish a member variable isHurt when hurt, not prevent all actions (HammerThrower still wants to move and throw)
  - get rid of all "super" methods in Sprite-derived classes
    - or not! look at all the stuff that Sprite.init does!

TODO
  - getting hit from the back should push you forward, not backward
  - fix keys (tie them to dungeons with a uniqueId on the entrance area?)
    - exit objects on overworld should specify 'dungeon' since ultimately I'll need to know in order to play the dungeon theme song -- i can use the entrance area's id as the dungeon id
  - elevators!
  - audio on android?
  - make it work in ie?
  
ONGOING:
  - add a couple more enemies (especially bigger enemies -- more satisfying to kill!)
