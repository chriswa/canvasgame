TODO
  - getting hit from the back should push you forward, not backward
  - fix keys (tie them to dungeons with a uniqueId on the entrance area?)
    - exit objects on overworld should specify dungeon since ultimately I'll need to know in order to pay the dungeon theme song
  - elevators!
  - audio on android? (or at least don't waste time downloading the samples)
  - make it work in ie?
ONGOING:
  - add a couple more enemies (especially bigger enemies -- more satisfying to kill!)
