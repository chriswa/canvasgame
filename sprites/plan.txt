- Exports packed sprite sheet PNGs and animation JSON

__MODEL__

Texture
- (directory name)
Slice (Texture)
- (image file)
AnimationGroup (Texture)
- name
- list of favorited slices (and default offsets)
Animation (AnimationGroup)
- name
- loop (y/n)
Frame (Animation)
- Slice
- offset
- duration

Note that Textures and Slices are represented solely by the filesystem. References to them are strings.

__VIEW__

Texture List
- select texture
Texture
- select/create AnimationGroup
AnimationGroup
- delete/rename this AnimationGroup
? add/remove favorited Slices
- select/create Animation
- preview (canvas) (click Animations to start them playing in this single canvas)
Animation
- delete/rename this Animation
- loop checkbox
- preview (canvas)
- list of Frames (add/delete)
  - offset x, offset x2 (flipped), offset y, duration textfields
  - Slice thumbnail (click to pick from Texture's Slices, favorites at top, you can unfavorite from here too)

Notes:
- picking a Frame adds the Slice to the AnimationGroup's favorites list
- saving a Frame updates the Slice's offset in the AnimationGroup's favorites list
- when adding a Frame, duration is defaulted to the previous Frame's and offset is defaulted to the values used previously for that Slice (from the favorites)
- all preview canvases show a horizontally mirrored version too (this is for checking offset x2)
- Textures, Slices, AnimationGroups, and Animations are listed alphabetically, when easiest to do so
